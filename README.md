# Transparent-Login-Form
Transparent Login Form that I learnt from Web Dev Simplified

I have done this project with these steps:

Firstly, I have watched the Youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLxA9froMOs

After I got what he did, I start coding <b>without looking video</b> (No parrot style)

When sometimes I stuck in some cases, I turn back the video and checked the part that I struggle.

What I learnt from this project : 
<ul>
<li>Focus concept</li>
<li>cursor: pointer</li>
<li>I get to re-check some topics</li>
<li>Even though same class they have, to provide an appearance line by line, we have to indicate div tags.</li>
</ul>
